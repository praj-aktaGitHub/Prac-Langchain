Built a chatbot that answers user queries using company FAQs and technical manuals. Used RAG with FAISS to search and fetch relevant information.

Created a basic multi-agent flow for classifying user intent and passing complex queries to a human agent. Added simple ticket creation and conversation history features.

Developed the frontend and backend for a real-time chat interface used by both users and IT agents for live support.


Built a tool that helps brands find suitable creators by using embeddings and FAISS to compare profiles and rank the best matches.

Created APIs for creator enrollment, embedding generation, similarity ranking, and brief refinement.

Added an automated email flow using HTML templates and SMTP for outreach.

Set up SQLite + FAISS storage and implemented a clean pipeline to store vectors and generate LLM-based scores and short explanations.


Built a tool that reads raw log files, extracts key events using regex, and groups errors into clear categories.

Used LLAMA models (via OpenRouter) to generate simple insights and summaries to help understand issues faster.

Combined Python data processing with basic charts/plots and connected everything to a small interactive frontend for easier viewing.


Cleaned and transformed user records, then calculated Recency, Frequency, and Monetary (RFM) values for each user.

Created clear segment labels such as Loyal, Potential, At Risk, and Lost based on RFM scores.

Visualized the data using distribution plots, boxplots, and short segment summaries to identify patterns.

Trained a Random Forest classifier on RFM features to predict user segments and evaluated it using a classification report and confusion matrix.



Built a real-time video analytics system using Mediapipe to monitor operator actions and ensure each step is performed in the correct order.

Defined ROIs for seal-placement, tracked hand positions continuously, and applied rule-based checks to validate every step.

Triggered on-screen warnings whenever a wrong movement or sequence was detected using lightweight edge-processing.

Developed a PyQt5 interface showing the live camera feed, cycle progress, detected errors, and final success status.
